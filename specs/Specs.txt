1. 

The next project piece is on scraping ETF holdings data. 
We have 6 different companies we’re doing this for and they are ETF Securities, Vanguard, VanEck, BetaShares and iShares.

We’ll keep it simple and start with one that does not need BeautifulSoup to run it and that’s ETF Securities.

There are 2 files in this.

First is an input file (ETF Securities List) which has a number of funds with their websites we are reading.

There is also a .PY file.

Create a folder for both of these files and then run the Python script. It should create a new folder where you’ll see the following output.

2. data conversion 

After that, when you look at the Excel file you will see the column B header is called Security Ticker and looks like this

In the example you see something with “1211 HK Equity”. 

We want to convert this into 2 new columns with column 1 keeping the 1211 part and column 2 keeping the “HK” part. This same process should run on the whole field.
