# ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)
The next project piece is on scraping ETF holdings data.
We have 6 different companies we’re doing this for and they are ETF Securities, Vanguard, VanEck, BetaShares and iShares. 
We’ll keep it simple and start with one that does not need BeautifulSoup to run it and that’s ETF Securities.  
There are 2 files in this.  First is an input file (ETF Securities List) which has a number of funds with their websites we are reading.  
There is also a .PY file.  
Create a folder for both of these files and then run the Python script. 
It should create a new folder where you’ll see the following output.
